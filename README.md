## Overview

This TypingMind Plugin uses the Jina.AI web search to fetch webpages for your LLM.  

## Usage

Simply ask the  LLM to  "search for [some search term] via the Jina plugin"


## Installation

1. Go to https://typingmind.com, select plugins on the left, and blue "Import"
   button on the right


2. Enter the repository url:
   https://github.com/ben-kenney/TMPlugin_jina_web_search

3. Go to Jina.AI and make an API key. At the time of this writing, the first
   1M tokens are free, and thereafter $20 per billion.

## Acknowledgments

This plugin is a replica of https://github.com/jdblack/typingmind_jina_web_reader but it adds the Jina.AI search endpoint.
